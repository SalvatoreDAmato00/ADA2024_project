Project realized for the class of "Advanced Data Analysis" for HEC Lausanne 2024.

The aim of the project is to predict corn future prices, and take into account the effect of wheather variables regarding the US Corn Belt. The US Corn Belt, in fact, accounts for the majority of US production, and has a big impact overall. Not only temperature and precipitation, but also how unexpected wheather impacts the price of derivatives.

The model with which I emplemented such study is a Long Short-Term Memory architecture. The effects of temperatures are studied thanks to SHAP analysis.

The file to refer to is "main.ipynb", where the analysis is conducted. The file "Temperatures_Data_ADA.ipynb" is the original file where I imported all the time series of temperatures, and merged them in one common file.
