# ADA2024_project

Project realized for the class of "Advanced Data Analysis" for HEC Lausanne 2024.

The aim of the project is to predict corn future prices, and take into account the effect of wheather variables. Not only temperature and precipitation, but also how unexpected wheather impacts the price of derivatives.

The model with which I emplemented such study is a Long Short-Term Memory architecture. The effects of temperatures are studied thanks to SHAP analysis.
